All React applications are --> Components

We create components for different parts,
    NavBar
    SearchBox
    Footer

Then Reacts job is to take those components and inject them into the DOM (Document Object Model).

This is done by, 

    NavBar      ---->
    SearchBar   ---->  Virtual DOM ---->  App
    Footer      ---->

    if we make a new change to the searchBox virtual DOM gets the new modification and compare it with the previous one and 
    update only the part that should be modified in the app without updating the 
    whole app.


*** COMPONENTS ***

1. looks like HTML but not HTML its actually JSX (JavaScript XML).
2. can contain a State (data or UI state). 
3. also can contain JavaScript for functionality.
